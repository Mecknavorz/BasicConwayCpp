# BasicConwayCpp
very basic implementation of conways game of life in c++

## Controls: 
Press space to iterate one step
Hold space for continuous iteration

Press R and then any mouse button to fill the screen with 50% living cells, value can be changed easily in the code and then recompiling.

Any mouse button to place a cell if the cell is dead, or kill a cell if it's alive.

Press q to quit.

## Current bug:
Something doesn't work with cell placement, so no manually placed cells seem to want to obey the rules, still trying to figure out why given that if enough cells are placed at random, standard emergent behavior occurs.
